Migration Guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From Previous Versions
"""""""""""""""""""""""

If you're upgrading from a previous version:

1. **No breaking changes** - all existing code should work
2. **Update imports** - some internal module paths may have changed
3. **Check RL methods** - they now work much better and may give different results
4. **Review examples** - many new examples available for reference

Recommended Updates
